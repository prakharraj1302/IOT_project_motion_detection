## Overview

Motion recognition has a wide range of real-world applications, from fitness tracking to gesture control. This project dives deep into the intersection of hardware and machine learning, with a specific emphasis on the Arm chip for efficient processing.

## Tech Stack & Hardware

- **Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 Sense:** This board is the hardware backbone of our motion recognition system. It features an onboard accelerometer and gyroscope, which we utilize for data acquisition.

- **Edge Impulse:** We leverage Edge Impulse for data processing, model development, and deployment. It's a powerful platform for building and deploying machine learning models on embedded systems.

## Project Phases

Our project is organized into several key phases:

1. **Data Acquisition & Cleaning:** High-quality data is essential for accurate recognition. In this phase, we focus on collecting and cleaning the data to establish a solid foundation for our model.

2. **Data Splitting and Processing:** We split and process the data to ensure our model receives reliable inputs. This step is critical for model training.


3. **Feature Engineering & Model Development:** Leveraging the power of the Arm chip, we develop a robust model capable of recognizing a wide range of motions.
